A web application, which uses the Facebook Login API and Google Maps API, created at HackNY Fall 2018 (Hackathon Project)

## APIs Used:

- Facebook Login for the Web with the JavaScript SDK
- Google Maps JavaScript API

### Project Purpose
The purpose of creating this web application was to familiaze myself with APIs as well as practice working collabortively with a group. My role included helping with the frontend code (HTML and CSS), as well as create a couple of jQuery functions to help with site navigation. I also embedded the Facbook Login JavaScript SDK API into our web application so a user could signup using their facebook account (a common way to signup).

### Project Description
This project aims to help users easily get updated notifictions on their facorite nearby stores. 

1. A user can signup using their Facebook credentials.
2. The Google Maps API will provide the server with the users current location and nearby stores. 
3. With this information, the web application will populate a page containing a list of nearby stores.
4. The User can click on a store and see relevent information about it:
  - When it will open
  - If there are any special closing hours
  - The ability to contact the store
  - The ability to sign-up for automated text notifications whenever a chnage is made to the store hours, using Twillio API (hasn't been implemented yet) 
  
> **NOTE:** *Our goal for this project was to promote local businesses and serve as a 
>        platform to help connect such businesses with their everyday customers.*
